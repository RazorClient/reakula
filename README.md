# Re-Akula

re-Akula is a passion-driven side project initiated by two developers, [Bartick](https://github.com/bartick) and [Tamaghna](https://github.com/RazorClient), who are deeply interested in exploring the complexities of Ethereum client software. With an ambitious goal of building a lightweight Ethereum client entirely in Rust, this project represents more than just a technical endeavorâ€”it is a means of gaining profound insights into the architecture of Ethereum clients and contributing meaningfully to the broader blockchain ecosystem.

## Project Namesake

The project is named after the Akula-class submarine, a symbol of stealth and power. Just as the Akula-class submarine is designed to operate silently and effectively in the depths of the ocean, re-Akula is designed to operate efficiently and securely in the depths of the Ethereum network. The project aims to build a lightweight Ethereum client that is capable of syncing with the Ethereum mainnet and executing transactions with minimal resource consumption.
